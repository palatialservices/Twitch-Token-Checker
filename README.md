Simple twitch token checker, using the third party website https://barrycarlyon.github.io/twitch_misc/examples/token_checker/ if you want to use this for mass checking i would suggest adding proxy support.

If you are experiencing issue's with speed or console bug lower the "max_workers" on line 65, or up it if you think it is to slow

Input Tokens to tokens.txt, Run main.py, check the Checked folder for outputed tokens
